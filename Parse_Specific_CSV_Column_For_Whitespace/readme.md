# Parse for whitespace

This specific script I wrote to detect trailing whitespace in channel names. This was an issue a while back where teams were somehow able to create channels with whitespace at the end. This caused a number of issues with rules (and I think a few other things).

Can easily be repurposed to check any field in a CSV really.
