# Fix encoding for message template import csv

Had to write this to correct some encoding issues with a CSV we were provided for a Message Template import. I believe it had to do with Latin charachters being present and those would be stripped
out when we attempted to upload.

The file is straight forward. Feel free to adjust the encoding types if neeed.
