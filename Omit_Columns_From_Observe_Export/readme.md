# Omit data from Observe export

Sometimes we have to export logs for customers, but we want to remove internal things. This script allows you to be selective in what rows should be included.

This file also includes a function to filter for the specific webhook a customer might be hitting with their rule. Used this multiple times to provide troubleshooting assistance for a team that couldn't figure out what webhooks they were using lol.
