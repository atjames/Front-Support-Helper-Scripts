# Convert JSON into a table

Script to convert a JSON object into a readable table. Just another way to visualize JSON.

Can be useful when working with the API or if something in HQ breaks and you have to inspect the object in console. 

(Stole this from a project I had at Uni years ago. I ran the code through ChatGPT in the hopes it added better comments cause I don't really remember any of this ^_^)
