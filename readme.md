# Front Support Helper Scripts

This is a repository full of different Python scripts that I've used at one point or another on the job at Front. I wanted to make these public for other T1.5/T2 peeps. These scripts vary and cover everything from working with Front's Core API, to manipulating CSV exports. Some of are very niche, while others I use daily. 

It should be noted all of these files are written in Python. Steps on getting Python up and running on your machine can be found below.





## How do I run these?

For documentation on how to get a Python env up and running on your machine check out: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html.

I would advise watching a YouTube video and doing some Google searches on the subject, before building your first env just so you know what's going on. It's pretty straight forward though. 

With that said, depending on the files you want to run, the necessary packages may vary. However, it's generally safe to install the following in your Python environment:

```bash
  pip install pandas
  pip install requests
  pip install beautifulsoup4
  pip install tabulate
```

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write and run the scripts. 

I've done my best to title the directories according to their function/contents, but feel free to ping me with any direct questions.
