# Find dup teammates

For a specific edge case where a large team was inviting duplicate users to their Front instance. Due to the large number of teammates it was quite difficult to navigate the 
Teammates table in HQ. 

This director has two files. The first titled setup_csv will clean the teammate tables export CSV so it only includes First Name, Last Name, and ID. It will output a csv tilted cleaned.csv

The second file can then be run to check for any duplicate First Name, Last Name combinations. 

Probably will never need to use this ever, but figured why not include it hehe xd
