# Convert Semi-colon delimiter to comma

Pretty straightforward script. Will replace the semi-colon delimiter with a comma. Script can be updated to work with any delimited really. :D 

Created because a few different customers have provided semi-colon delimited "CSVs" and asked why they aren't working with our CSV uploaders.
